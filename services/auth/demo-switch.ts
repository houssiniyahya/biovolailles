 * exact same login() path a manual email/password submission would (same credential check,
 * same session mint), just with the demo flag set so the UI can show "Mode démo" unambiguously.
 * It is deliberately NOT a client-side role toggle: nothing here writes role/scope into the
 * session without a real user row and a real password check backing it.
