# BIOVOLAILLES — Release Notes (MVP Release Candidate)

**Version:** MVP RC · **Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** ready for external demonstration

BIOVOLAILLES is a functional Agritech MVP: a digital operating, intelligence and traceability
platform for poultry production. It is not a dashboard bolted onto a spreadsheet, and it is
not an AI product — it is one coherent system carrying a flock from the building it lives in
to the QR code a consumer scans.

Every figure in this document was measured against a production build of this codebase. Where
something is simulated or absent, this document says so plainly.

---

## 1. What the MVP includes

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| Authentication (encrypted cookie sessions) | Implemented |
| 6 roles + hierarchical data scoping, enforced server-side | Implemented |
| Organization → cooperative → producer → farm → building → lot | Implemented |
| Structured production data (feed, water, weight, mortality, environment) | Implemented |
| Data-status vocabulary on every value (Real / Simulation / Calculated / Estimated / To confirm / Validated / Missing) | Implemented |
| Provenance on every measurement (source, actor, device, timestamp, method, formula) | Implemented |
| IoT devices, sensors, measurement history | Implemented — **simulated source** |
| KPI engine with explicit eligibility (refuses to compute what it cannot justify) | Implemented |
| Performance trends | Implemented |
| Rule-based anomaly detection with an 8-question explanation | Implemented |
| Alert lifecycle → human acknowledgement → action record → lot event | Implemented |
| Lot-centric traceability graph (upstream / lot / downstream) | Implemented |
| Product lineage: collection → slaughter → transformation → product → destination | Implemented |
| Public QR traceability passport with a single curated boundary | Implemented |
| Audit log of every mutation (actor, before/after, reason) | Implemented |
| Integrity engine — 477 automated checks (T01–T27) | Implemented |
| Demo reset + system health screen | Implemented |
| French UI throughout, WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigable | Implemented |

**Scale of the seeded dataset:** 1 organization · 3 cooperatives · 7 producers · 8 farms ·
12 buildings · 12 lots · 6 users · 525 IoT measurements · 9 anomalies/alerts · 1 complete
farm-to-product chain · 2 public QR passports.

## 2. What is simulated

- **All IoT measurements.** Produced by a deterministic simulator (seeded hash noise, never
  `Math.random`). No physical sensor exists. The label "Simulation" is visible in the UI
  wherever such a value is shown.
- **All production data.** The 12 lots, their histories, and the anomalies are demonstration
  content, not records of a real farm. They are, however, **calibrated against the Ross 308
  breed standard** — body-weight curve (42 g at hatch, 943 g at day 21, 2 283 g at day 35),
  feed-intake curve, feed conversion between 1.4 and 2.1 across lots, 70% carcass yield and
  90% deboning yield, with exact mass balance at every processing step. Simulated is not the
  same as invented: a poultry engineer can check these numbers against the breed tables.
- **The downstream chain.** Collection, slaughter, transformation, product and destination
  records are seeded demonstration data.

Because the data is simulated, the public passport honestly reports **"Traçabilité non
vérifiée"**. The public verification status is computed from real system state, not decoration.

## 3. What is NOT implemented

- Physical IoT hardware integration (the measurement *source* is the only swap point)
- Machine learning or statistical anomaly models — detection is explicit rules, by design
- Industrial or multi-tenant deployment; no load testing has been performed
- Full cooperative rollout
- Certification / document entity (passport certifications are therefore always empty)
- Mobile application
- Languages other than French
- Rate limiting on the public passport route
- Age-adjusted environmental setpoints. `TEMPERATURE_OUT_OF_RANGE` is an absolute safety
  envelope (18-33 degC, tolerable at any age), not a brooding-to-finishing setpoint curve, so
  it cannot flag "28 degC is too warm for a five-week flock". Stated as such in the rule text.
- Sanitary observation. A `sanitary_observations` table and domain type exist in the schema,
  but there is no repository implementation, no service, no UI and the seed never writes a
  row — it is a modelled shape, not a capability.

## 4. Known limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|---|---|
| The FCR (feed conversion) KPI reports "Donnée insuffisante" on the hero lot | Deliberate: the engine refuses to publish an indicator it cannot justify. 5 of 6 KPIs compute. |
| The seeded scenario is anchored to fixed dates around 2026-08-16 | Guarantees determinism, but the dataset visibly ages as real time passes. Re-date the seed if demoing months from now. |
| The hero farm shows "0 active lots" | Correct, not a bug — the hero lot is `CLOTURE`, which is *why* it has a product and a passport. See `DEMO_RUNBOOK.md` §2 for how to open the demo. |
| `notFound()` pages return HTTP 200 with correct "Introuvable" content | Next.js streams after the shell starts; content and UX are correct, the status code is not. |
| `npm run db:reset` fails with `EBUSY` while the server is running | Windows file lock. Use the in-app reset during a demo. Documented. |
| A demo reset invalidates all open sessions | The users table is recreated. Log in again. Documented. |
| Client JS is ~680–735 KB uncompressed per route | Acceptable for an authenticated internal tool; not optimised to a public-site budget. |
| `/integrite` takes ~1 s | It runs 477 real checks across the whole database. Admin screen, not a hot path. |
| Integrity reports 4 warnings | Deliberate — quality defects are seeded so the engine has something true to find. **Zero critical issues.** |
| The hero lot's feed conversion ratio is ~2.0 (poor) | Deliberate and coherent: the lot is flagged for eating 25% above pattern while its growth falls 33% short. A good FCR would contradict its own alert. |

## 5. How to start the application

Requires Node.js 20+. No account, API key, cloud service or internet connection is needed.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then set SESSION_SECRET (32+ chars)
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run build
npm run start                   # http://localhost:3000
```

For development: `npm run dev`.

**The application runs fully offline.** There are no outbound HTTP calls in application code,
and the Inter font is self-hosted at build time.

## 6. How to seed / reset demo data

| | Command / location | Server state |
|---|---|---|
| Full reset (drops the file, re-migrates, re-seeds) | `npm run db:reset` | **Must be stopped** |
| In-app reset (truncates rows, re-seeds) | `/administration/demo` → Réinitialiser | **Must be running** |

The in-app reset is guarded three ways: `DEMO_MODE` must be on, the caller needs
`EDIT`/`SETTINGS` permission, and the database must contain the seeded demo admin — so it
cannot be pointed at a non-demo database.

Both paths run the *same* `seedDatabase()`, so both produce an identical scenario. Verified
byte-identical across three consecutive reseeds, including the QR tokens.

**Public passport URLs are stable across resets** (a printed QR keeps working):

- Lot: `/tracabilite/qj3nAI3lfRg_k6BlmfLU8OKcVejnTjMd`
- Product: `/tracabilite/8y7Vt4vG0tZKO6aRW_vJiBSMFr_qCdyF`

Internal UUIDs (lot, farm, device URLs) **do** change on reseed — navigate by clicking.

## 7. Demo accounts

All six share the password `Demo1234!`. Internal document — do not distribute publicly.

| Role | Email | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Administrateur | `admin@biovolailles.demo` | Global |
| Responsable coopérative | `coop.manager@biovolailles.demo` | Coopérative Al Baraka |
| Producteur | `producteur@biovolailles.demo` | Producer |
| Responsable ferme | `ferme.manager@biovolailles.demo` | Ferme Al Baraka |
| Technicien | `technicien@biovolailles.demo` | Ferme Al Baraka |
| Auditeur | `auditeur@biovolailles.demo` | Global, read-only |

Role switching from the top bar performs a **real re-authentication**, not a UI toggle.

## 8. Demo flow

The hero scenario is `BU-2026-001`. Full script, timings (3/5/10 min) and troubleshooting
are in **`DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`**. In short:

```
Dashboard → Farm → Building → Lot → IoT → Performance/KPI
   → Anomaly → Alert → Acknowledge → Event
   → Traceability → Product → QR passport → what the public cannot see
```

Verified end to end against a production server, for every role.
