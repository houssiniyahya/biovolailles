/**
 * The counterpart to seedHeroTraceabilityChain: a *validated* chain, so the demo can show both
 * halves of the public passport's verdict instead of only the cautious one.
 *
 * The hero lot BU-2026-001 is SIMULATION throughout and deliberately reads "Traçabilité non
 * vérifiée" (DEMO_RUNBOOK.md §8). That is the honest default, but on its own it leaves the
 * question "so what does a verified passport look like?" unanswered. BU-2025-010 answers it:
 * a cycle that closed in January 2026, whose downstream records were since confirmed, so every
 * record here carries dataStatus VALIDE and the product passport renders "Vérifié" with no
 * demo-data banner and every step green.
 *
 * Three constraints shaped this, and each is worth keeping if the numbers are ever edited:
 *
 * 1. No lifecycle transition. BU-2025-010 is seeded CLOTURE and stays CLOTURE. Re-seeding it
 *    as ACTIF so it could be walked through the lifecycle would put it in front of the rule
 *    engine as a live lot (seed-database.ts runs detection *before* this generator), which
 *    would change the documented anomaly/alert counts. A completed 2025 cycle acquiring its
 *    downstream records is also simply what happened.
 * 2. Every record sets measurementMethod. checkProvenance() in domain/quality/checks.ts warns
 *    on REEL/VALIDE data with no sourceId, documentId *or* measurementMethod — so validated
 *    records without a stated method would each add an integrity warning.
 * 3. Quantities are exact integers under the lot's own ceiling. resolveAvailableQuantity()
 *    caps a KG collection at currentPopulation × latest average weight = 10 680 × 2.28 =
 *    24 350.4 kg; 24 000 sits under it, and each stage's parts sum exactly so the
 *    equality checks in domain/production/quantity-integrity.ts pass without slack.
 *
 * Note this deliberately produces a verified *product* passport, not a verified *lot* one:
 * the lot passport only reads verified at status LIBERE, which ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS reaches
 * solely from BLOQUE — a released quality hold, not a completed cycle. A finished lot is
 * CLOTURE, and CLOTURE is not a verified state.
